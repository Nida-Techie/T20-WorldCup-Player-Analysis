## 🔹 Steps I Followed

  - Most Runs  
  - Most Wickets  

### 2. Data Cleaning (Python + Pandas)  
- Removed extra spaces  
- Replaced "-" with NaN  
- Converted numeric columns to float/int  
- Exported cleaned CSVs  

### 3. Data Transformation (Power Query in Power BI)  
- Refined columns

- Kept only relevant columns  

### 4. Player Master Table (Power Query)  
- Created reference queries for Player column  
- Appended into one table

- Final table: **Players**  

### 5. Data Modeling & DAX (Power BI)  
- Relationships built:  
  - Players ↔ Most Runs
